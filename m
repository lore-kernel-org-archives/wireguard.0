I considered adding some of that metadata too, as I am actually removing
it for wireguard (in comment form, but still).

In include/uapi/linux/wireguard.h in the comment block at the top, it is
very clear that wireguard only used type 0 for all the nested array
entries, however the truth is that it doesn't care. It therefore doesn't
matter if the generated -user.* keeps track of the index in .idx, or that
cli.py decodes a JSON array and sends it with indexes, it's not needed,
but it still works.

In practice I don't think we will break any clients if we enforced it, and
validated that wireguard only accepts type 0 entries, in it's nested arrays.

For the other families, I don't know how well defined it is, Johannes have
stated that nl80211 doesn't care which types are used, but I have no idea
how consistent clients have abused that statement to send random data,
or do they all just send zeros?

This would make a lot more sense if 'array-nest' hadn't been renamed to
'indexed-array' in ynl, because it feels wrong to add 'unindexed: true' now.
We could also call it 'all-zero-indexed: true'.

In cli.py this gives some extra issues, as seen in [1], the nested arrays
are outputted as '[{0: {..}}, {0: {..}}, ..]', but on input has the format
'[{..},{..}, ..]' because it has to be JSON-compatible on input.

If we had an attribute like 'all-zero-indexed' then cli.py, could also output
'[{..},{..}, ..]'.
