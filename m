Sorry, yes, I noticed I wrote it in a confusing way.

I meant to say, we don't require the IPv6 "API" to behave in a similar
way like the IPv4 one. We do this function pointer trick to allow
_in-kernel_ tree modules to use the function dynamically, even the
kernel ipv6 module would be available but is not loaded but don't
guarante any "API like IPv4" to outside tree modules.

I tried to make the point, that it is still something internal to the
kernel if compared to out-of-tree function users. And that different
behavior by itself doesn't count as a bug.

We could as well require the users of this function to check for the
source address before or require to check the source address after the
ipv6_dst_lookup call.

vxlan currently seems wrong and would impacted by this patch in a better
way, so I am all in for such a change, but I think we need to check if
we are also correct scope-wise and not just match for the address on its
own.

Thanks,
Hannes
