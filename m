Properly resolved by whom? It sounds like you're up for intentionally
allowing a userspace regression, and also volunteering other people's
time into fixing that regression? The way I understand the kernel
development process is that the person proposing a change is responsible
for not intentionally causing regressions, and if one is pointed out, a
v+1 of that patch is provided that doesn't cause the regression.

It's systems that go to sleep all the time, nonstop, like Android
handsets do. I'm fine with a compile time constant for this, or some
runtime sysctl, or whatever else. It doesn't really matter to me. The
only concern is that the Android people are okay with it and enable it
(and that the distros don't enable it, I guess). So whatever they want
is fine.  Or maybe such a runtime indicator already exists. I'm not
sure. But I think a v+1 of this patchset needs to work that out in one
direction or another.

To put it simply,

    - I highly suspect that this patch will cause a regression.
    - I don't have a ready-made solution offhand to fix said regression.
    - The submitter of the patch, now aware of regression potential,
      should look into not causing that regression.

That seems pretty clear cut: you're welcome to improve it, but please
don't *intentionally* break my code.

Jason
