Your custom protocol should be designed in a way you get an aligned ip
header. Most protocols of the IETF follow this mantra and it is always
possible to e.g. pad options so you end up on aligned boundaries for the
next header.

GRE-TEB for example needs skb_copy_bits to extract the header so it can
access them in an aligned way.

I don't see an issue with that at all. Why do you think it could be a
problem?
