No worries, Jakub is also colored yellow.  People added tomorrow

Or not, if there has been a leak and there happens to be no outstanding
kfree_rcu() memory.

And the batch freeing can be replicated across CPUs, so it would be
necessary to determine which was last to do this effective.  Don't get
me wrong, this can be done, but the performance/latency tradeoffs can
be interesting.

I agree that kfree_rcu_work-batch time is a good time to evaluate slab
(and I have added this to the document), but I do not believe that it
can completely replace timeouts.
