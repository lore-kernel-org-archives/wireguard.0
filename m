Works for me!

That does sound like a very attractive approach.

Agreed.

There are some use cases where a call_rcu() from a module without an
rcu_barrier() would be OK, for example, if the callback function was
defined in the core kernel and either: (1) The memory was from kmalloc()
or (2) The memory was from kmem_cache_alloc() and your suggested
changes above have been applied.  My current belief is that these are
too special of cases to be worth optimizing for, so that the rule should
remain "If you use call_rcu() in a module, you must call rcu_barrier()
within the module-unload code."

There have been discussions of having module-unload automatically invoke
rcu_barrier() if needed, but thus far we have not come up with a good
way to do this.  Challenges include things like static inline functions
from the core kernel invoking call_rcu(), in which case how to figure
out that the rcu_barrier() is not needed?

							Thanx, Paul
