BTW, I think this whole thing might be caused by:

    a35d16905efc ("rcu: Add basic support for kfree_rcu() batching")

The commit message there mentions:

    There is an implication with rcu_barrier() with this patch. Since the
    kfree_rcu() calls can be batched, and may not be handed yet to the RCU
    machinery in fact, the monitor may not have even run yet to do the
    queue_rcu_work(), there seems no easy way of implementing rcu_barrier()
    to wait for those kfree_rcu()s that are already made. So this means a
    kfree_rcu() followed by an rcu_barrier() does not imply that memory will
    be freed once rcu_barrier() returns.

Before that, a kfree_rcu() used to just add a normal call_rcu() into the
list, but with the function offset < 4096 as a special marker. So the
kfree_rcu() calls would be treated alongside the other call_rcu() ones
and thus affected by rcu_barrier(). Looks like that behavior is no more
since this commit.

Rather than getting rid of the batching, which seems good for
efficiency, I wonder if the right fix to this would be adding a
`should_destroy` boolean to kmem_cache, which kmem_cache_destroy() sets
to true. And then right after it checks `if (number_of_allocations == 0)
actually_destroy()`, and likewise on each kmem_cache_free(), it could
check `if (should_destroy && number_of_allocations == 0)
actually_destroy()`. This way, the work is delayed until it's safe to do
so. This might also mitigate other lurking bugs of bad code that calls
kmem_cache_destroy() before kmem_cache_free().
