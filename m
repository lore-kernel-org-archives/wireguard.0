Ultimately I intend to submit my own use case for mainline inclusion.
I have no intention of maintaining my work as exclusively out of tree
and would be very pleased to see this well integrated. Hopefully I'll
meet some of you in person at upcoming conferences and events for
discussion about this.

Were I only concerned about out of tree status, I'd have no hesitation
about just including these particular checks in my own code and
leaving the current in tree code to rot. However, with my final
intentions in mind, it's certainly in my interest to "do things
right", hence this thread. When I noticed that the ipv6_stub routing
function was insufficient for my own project, I examined its usage in
a few other places. And indeed vxlan and geneve seem to also benefit
from this patch. I'd be happy to audit the small handful of other
cases in the kernel that use this API; I suspect they'll also be
improved in a positive way.

To the extent that other in-tree code uses this function and doesn't
get the saddr check, it seems like a bug. To the extent that this
function becomes more correct, it seems like an improvement. But
whether a bug or a mere improvement, it seems like a net positive.

As said above, I have no qualms about doing this check in my own code.
I was thinking, though, that a handful of other places in the kernel
that use this function would benefit from adding that check too. In
this case, it's usually common practice to move the check into the
shared function, rather than require a flurry of copy-and-paste.

I'll have a better look at this. Perhaps this should be modeled on
what we currently do for userspace, which might amount to something
more or less like:
