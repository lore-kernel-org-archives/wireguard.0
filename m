Yes, I can see that being an issue.  However, if you're doing zero-copy
routing, the header part of the original buffer should still be there,
unused, so you could presumably copy the header of the outgoing packet
there and then do dma as usual.  Maybe there's something in the network
stack that makes this impossible though.
