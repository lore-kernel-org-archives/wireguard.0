What do you mean by 'valid dst'? ipv6 returns net->ipv6.ip6_null_entry on lookup failures so yes dst is non-NULL but that does not mean the lookup succeeded.

For example take a look at ip6_dst_lookup_tail():
        if (!*dst)
                *dst = ip6_route_output_flags(net, sk, fl6, flags);

        err = (*dst)->error;
        if (err)
                goto out_err_release;


perhaps I should add dst->error to the fib tracepoints ...
