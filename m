wireguard: account peer and allowedips allocations to memcg

This patch creates the wg_peer and allowedips_node slab caches with
SLAB_ACCOUNT. It also switches the per-peer dst_cache and the per-device
pubkey and index hashtables to GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT. The goal is to stop a
user with a user and network namespace from escaping its memory cgroup
limit by adding peers over WG_CMD_SET_DEVICE.

> The keypair allocations are left alone, as they happen from the handshake
> worker and are bounded to three per peer.

[Severity: Medium]
Does the per-peer bound make the keypair memory small enough to ignore?

struct noise_keypair embeds a noise_replay_counter with:

    unsigned long backtrack[COUNTER_BITS_TOTAL / BITS_PER_LONG];

COUNTER_BITS_TOTAL is 8192, so that is a 1KB bitmap. The struct ends up
around 1.2KB, which means keypair_create() is served from kmalloc-2k:

drivers/net/wireguard/noise.c:keypair_create() {
	struct noise_keypair *keypair = kzalloc_obj(*keypair);
    ...
}

add_new_keypair() keeps two keypairs in slots per peer, plus any that are
in flight or waiting on RCU. That is about 4KB or more of uncharged memory
per peer. The now-charged wg_peer object plus the per-CPU dst_cache come
to about 2KB.

The configuring user picks every peer public key, so it knows the matching
private keys. A UDP program in the same netns can send valid handshake
initiations for every peer to the listen port. The responder path then
allocates keypairs from the kworker:

wg_packet_handshake_receive_worker()
  wg_packet_send_handshake_response()
    wg_noise_handshake_begin_session()
      keypair_create()

Once the peer count is limited only by charged memory, could the
uncharged keypair memory still reach about 1-2x memory.max?

This runs in a worker, so GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT alone would charge root.
Would this need the configuring memcg to be recorded, with
set_active_memcg() used in the handshake path?

[Severity: High]
The peer slab and dst_cache are now charged. Does each peer still pin a
larger amount of uncharged memory through its NAPI kthread?

wg_newlink() turns on threaded NAPI for every wireguard device:

	netif_threaded_enable(dev);
	ret = register_netdevice(dev);

Later in wg_peer_create(), each peer does:

	netif_napi_add(wg->dev, &peer->napi, wg_packet_rx_poll);

Peers have no napi->config, so napi_get_threaded_config() returns
dev->threaded. That spawns one kthread per peer:

wg_peer_create()
  netif_napi_add()
    netif_napi_add_weight_locked()
      napi_kthread_create()
        kthread_run(napi_threaded_poll, n, "napi/%s-%d", ...)

kthreadd forks the thread. Its task_struct and kernel stack (about
20-30KB) are therefore charged to the root memcg. The PID is also taken
outside the caller's pids cgroup and RLIMIT_NPROC.

Each peer charges only about 2KB for wg_peer plus dst_cache. Could a
cgroup with memory.max=64M still create tens of thousands of peers and pin
hundreds of MiB of uncharged memory? With a larger limit, could this also
use up pid_max for the whole system?

More GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT flags would not cover this, because kthreadd does
the allocation. Would this need a per-device or per-user cap on peers or
NAPI threads, or a design that does not spawn a kthread per peer?

The next patch in the series ("wireguard: noise: recheck replay and flood
under write lock on initiation") only changes the replay checks in
noise.c and does not affect this.

[Severity: Medium]
The two per-device hashtables are now charged, and the commit message
says the number of devices has no limit. Are the other per-device
allocations in wg_newlink() still uncharged?

wg_newlink() calls wg_packet_queue_init() three times, and each call
does:

drivers/net/wireguard/queueing.c:wg_packet_queue_init() {
    ...
	ret = ptr_ring_init(&queue->ring, len, GFP_KERNEL);
    ...
	queue->worker = wg_packet_percpu_multicore_worker_alloc(function, queue);
    ...
}

ptr_ring_init() ends up in kvmalloc_array() with GFP_KERNEL. On 64-bit
that is 8KB + 8KB + 32KB per device (MAX_QUEUED_PACKETS and
MAX_QUEUED_INCOMING_HANDSHAKES).

The per-CPU worker arrays come from alloc_percpu() without
__GFP_ACCOUNT:

	struct multicore_worker __percpu *worker = alloc_percpu(struct multicore_worker);

wg_newlink() also creates three workqueues. packet_crypt_wq uses
WQ_MEM_RECLAIM, which adds a rescuer kthread forked by kthreadd:

	wg->packet_crypt_wq = alloc_workqueue("wg-crypt-%s",
			WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE | WQ_MEM_RECLAIM | WQ_PERCPU, 0,
			dev->name);

Could a user with user and net namespaces call RTM_NEWLINK in a loop to
create wireguard devices? That would still allocate per-device memory
that never shows up in memory.current.

Should the ptr_ring and per-CPU worker allocations be charged as well?
