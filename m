I'll need to do my own reading, I guess, but what is going on with this
"legacy" business? Is there some newer genetlink that falls outside of
versioning?

There's lots of control over the C output here. Why can't there also be
a top-level c-function-prefix attribute, so that patch 10/11 is
unnecessary? Stack traces for wireguard all include wg_; why pollute
this with the new "wireguard_" ones?

I think get/set might match the operations better than the underlying
netlink verbs? This is a doc comment specific to getting and setting.

On the other hand, maybe that's an implementation detail and doesn't
need to be specified? Or if you think rigidity is important, we should
specify 0 in both directions and then validate it to ensure userspace
sends 0 (all userspaces currently do).

There's an extra line break before the "So," that wasn't there in the
original.

Either "While" or ", but" but not both.

However, can we actually just make this strict? No userspaces send
random attributes in a GET. Nothing should break.

Oh, or, the wg_ prefix can be defined here (instead of wireguard_, per
my 10/11 comment above).

As mentioned earlier, maybe this can be reduced to ifindex+ifname.

More odd linebreaks added. Either it's a new paragraph or it isn't. Keep
this how it was before?
