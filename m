BTW: I think you CCed too many developers here. There are situations
where this can makes sense, but it's rare. And if you do this too often
people might start to not really look into your mails or might even
ignore them completely.

Normally it's enough to write the mail to (1) the people in the
signed-off-by-chain, (2) the maintainers of the subsystem that merged a
commit, and (3) the lists for all affected subsystems; leave it up to
developers from the first two groups to CC the maintainers of the third
group.

I'd be careful to ask people that, as that might mean a lot of work for
them. Best to leave things like that to developers, unless it's pretty
obvious that something went sideways.

What makes your think so? I just looked at bugzilla and it (for now)
seems reverting fed8d8773b8ea6 ontop of 6.4 fixed things for the
reporter, which is a pretty strong indicator that this change really
causes the trouble somehow.

/me really wonders what's he's missing

Not much apart from updating regzbot state (e.g. something like "regzbot
introduced v6.3..v6.4") and a reply to your initial report (ideally with
a quick apology) to let everyone know it was a false alarm.
